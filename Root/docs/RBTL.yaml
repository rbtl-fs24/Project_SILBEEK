    There is a recognised need to improve recycling rates. One current issue is
    that knowledge and incentives to recycle are sometimes lacking. Mechanisms
    of gamification can be used to motivate and engage people to recycle, but
    this has not been thoroughly explored to date. To address this issue, four
    focus groups were conducted to bridge the gap between gamification and
    recycling behaviour. Results from these focus groups showed that functional
    solutions are preferred and that gamification can preferably be implemented
    digitally to bridge the gap between behaviour and knowledge. Feedback,
    awards, achievements, collaborative and competitive elements, as well as
    supplementary functions are gamified mechanisms that can be used for this
    purpose. This study contributes to the understanding and implementation of
    gamification for use in waste management and to influence positive recycling
    behaviour.

    Globally, waste volumes are increasing rapidly and the World Bank estimates
    a 70% global increase in municipal solid waste up to 2025. Waste may have
    serious environmental consequences and there is a strong correlation between
    solid waste generation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. These two
    observations alone indicate that this development is not sustainable.
    Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce
    the environmental impact of waste. While, waste recycling in OECD countries
    is reported to be approximately 22% on average, many developing countries
    have recycling rates in the range of 1â€“3%. A key aspect in succeeding with
    any recycling effort is how authorities and other actors relate to both
    informal and formal waste workers. This paper reports on the findings of a
    systematic literature study with the aim of exploring waste recycling
    behavior, with a special focus on motivational factors, both physical and
    psychological, behind recycling. Three levels of descending importance for
    recycling have been identified, where two are vital for success, and the
    third is desirable; 1) a well-designed infrastructure for recycling 2)
    specific recycling knowledge, and, 3) a general understanding of
    environmental aspects. Any attempt to implement or improve recycling systems
    and/or recycling behavior, needs to consider these aspects and the insights
    gained through this research may provide decision makers with practical
    assistance. The paper also contributes by providing academia with a
    framework for further studies on the behavioral aspects of recycling.

    The present world is now facing the challenge of proper management and
    resource recovery of the enormous amount of plastic waste. Lack of technical
    skills for managing hazardous waste, insufficient infrastructure development
    for recycling and recovery, and above all, lack of awareness of the rules
    and regulations are the key factors behind this massive pile of plastic
    waste. The severity of plastic pollution exerts an adverse effect on the
    environment and total ecosystem. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of
    plastic waste generation, as well as its effect on the human being and
    ecological system, is discussed in terms of source identification with
    respect to developed and developing countries. A detailed review of the
    existing waste to energy and product conversion strategies is presented in
    this study. Moreover, this study sheds light on sustainable waste management
    procedures and identifies the key challenges to adopting effective measures
    to minimise the negative impact of plastic waste.
