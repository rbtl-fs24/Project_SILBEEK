  abstract = {There is a recognised need to improve recycling rates. One current issue is that knowledge and incentives to recycle are sometimes lacking. Mechanisms of gamification can be used to motivate and engage people to recycle, but this has not been thoroughly explored to date. To address this issue, four focus groups were conducted to bridge the gap between gamification and recycling behaviour. Results from these focus groups showed that functional solutions are preferred and that gamification can preferably be implemented digitally to bridge the gap between behaviour and knowledge. Feedback, awards, achievements, collaborative and competitive elements, as well as supplementary functions are gamified mechanisms that can be used for this purpose. This study contributes to the understanding and implementation of gamification for use in waste management and to influence positive recycling behaviour.},

  abstract = {Globally, waste volumes are increasing rapidly and the World Bank estimates a 70\% global increase in municipal solid waste up to 2025. Waste may have serious environmental consequences and there is a strong correlation between solid waste generation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. These two observations alone indicate that this development is not sustainable. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the environmental impact of waste. While, waste recycling in OECD countries is reported to be approximately 22\% on average, many developing countries have recycling rates in the range of 1--3\%. A key aspect in succeeding with any recycling effort is how authorities and other actors relate to both informal and formal waste workers. This paper reports on the findings of a systematic literature study with the aim of exploring waste recycling behavior, with a special focus on motivational factors, both physical and psychological, behind recycling. Three levels of descending importance for recycling have been identified, where two are vital for success, and the third is desirable; 1) a well-designed infrastructure for recycling 2) specific recycling knowledge, and, 3) a general understanding of environmental aspects. Any attempt to implement or improve recycling systems and/or recycling behavior, needs to consider these aspects and the insights gained through this research may provide decision makers with practical assistance. The paper also contributes by providing academia with a framework for further studies on the behavioral aspects of recycling.},

  abstract = {The present world is now facing the challenge of proper management and resource recovery of the enormous amount of plastic waste. Lack of technical skills for managing hazardous waste, insufficient infrastructure development for recycling and recovery, and above all, lack of awareness of the rules and regulations are the key factors behind this massive pile of plastic waste. The severity of plastic pollution exerts an adverse effect on the environment and total ecosystem. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of plastic waste generation, as well as its effect on the human being and ecological system, is discussed in terms of source identification with respect to developed and developing countries. A detailed review of the existing waste to energy and product conversion strategies is presented in this study. Moreover, this study sheds light on sustainable waste management procedures and identifies the key challenges to adopting effective measures to minimise the negative impact of plastic waste.},
